# Nsfw-Classify-Tensorflow
NSFW classify model implemented with tensorflow. Use nsfw dataset provided here
https://github.com/alexkimxyz/nsfw_data_scraper Thanks for sharing the dataset
with us. You can find all the model details here. Don not hesitate to raise an
issue if you're confused with the model.

## Installation
This software has only been tested on ubuntu 16.04(x64). Here is the test environment
info

**OS**: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

**GPU**: Two GTX 1070TI 

**CUDA**: cuda 9.0

**Tensorflow**: tensorflow 1.12.0

**OPENCV**: opencv 3.4.1

**NUMPY**: numpy 1.15.1

Other required package you may install them by

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test model
In this repo I uploaded a pretrained dataset introduced as before, you need to 
download the pretrained [weights_file](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yfc3hy7enopdxj2/AADek2FlqCW1_j8Ax5x_VQy8a?dl=0) 
in folder REPO_ROOT_DIR/model/.

You can test a single image on the trained model as follows

```
cd REPO_ROOT_DIR
python tools/test_model.py --weights_path model/new_model/nsfw_cls.ckpt-100000
--image_path data/test_data/test_drawing.jpg
```

The following part will show you how the dataset is well prepared

## Train your own model

#### Data Preparation
First you need to download all the origin nsfw data. Here is the 
[how_to_download_source_data](https://github.com/alexkimxyz/nsfw_data_scraper).
The training example should be organized like the what you can see in 
REPO_ROOT_DIR/data/nsfw_dataset_example. Then you should modified the 
REPO_ROOT_DIR/tools/make_nsfw_dataset.sh with your local nsfw dataset. Then excute
the dataset preparation script. That may take about one hour in my local machine.
You may enlarge the __C.TRAIN.CPU_MULTI_PROCESS_NUMS in config/global_config.py 
if you have a powerful cpu to accelerate the prepare process.

```
cd REPO_ROOT_DIR
bash tools/make_nsfw_dataset.sh
```

The image of each subclass will be split into three part according to the ratio
training : validation : test = 0.75 : 0.1 : 0.15. All the image will be convert
into tensorflow format record for efficient importing data pipline.

#### Train Model
The model support multi-gpu training. If you want to training the model on 
multiple gpus you need to first adjust the __C.TRAIN.GPU_NUM in config/global_config.py
file. Then excute the multi-gpu training procedure as follows:

```
cd REPO_ROOT_DIR
python tools/train_nsfw.py --dataset_dir PATH/TO/PREPARED_NSFW_DATASET --use_multi_gpu True
```

If you want to train the model from last snap shot you may excute following command:

```
cd REPO_ROOT_DIR
python tools/train_nsfw.py --dataset_dir PATH/TO/PREPARED_NSFW_DATASET 
--use_multi_gpu True --weights_path PATH/TO/YOUR/LAST_CKPT_FILE_PATH
```

You may set the --use_multi_gpu False then the whole training process will be excuted
on single gpu.

The main model's hyperparameter are as follows:

**iterations nums**: 160010

**learning rate**: 0.1

**batch size**: 32

**origin image size**: 256

**cropped image size**: 224

**training example nums**: 159477

**testing example nums**: 31895

**validation example nums**: 21266

The rest of the hyperparameter can be found [here](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/nsfw-classification-tensorflow/blob/master/config/global_config.py).

If you want to convert the downloaded ckpt model into tensorflow saved model
you can simply modify the file path in ROOT_DIR/tools/export_nsfw_saved_model.sh
and run it.

```
bash tools/export_nsfw_saved_model.sh
```

You may monitor the training process using tensorboard tools

During my experiment the `train loss` drops as follows:  
![train_loss](/data/images/avg_train_loss.png)

The `train_top_1_error` rises as follows:  
![train_top_1_error](/data/images/avg_train_top1_error.png)

The `validation loss` drops as follows:  
![validation_loss](/data/images/avg_val_loss.png)

The `validation_top_1_error` rises as follows:  
![validation_top_1_error](/data/images/avg_val_top1_error.png)

#### The Model Evaluation 

You can evaluate the model's performance on the nsfw dataset prepared in
advance as follows

```
cd REPO_ROOT_DIR
python tools/evaluate_nsfw.py --weights_path model/new_model/nsfw_cls.ckpt-160000
--dataset_dir PATH/TO/YOUR/NSFW_DATASET
```

After you run the script you should see something like this 
![evaluation_result](/data/images/evaluation_nsfw.png)

The model's main evaluation index are as follows:

**Precision**: 0.92406 with average weighted on each class

**Recall**: 0.92364 with average weighted on each class

**F1 score**: 0.92344 with average weighted on each class

The `Confusion_Matrix` is as follows:  
![confusion_matrix](/data/images/confusion_matrix.png)

The `Precison_Recall` is as follows:  
![precision_recall](/data/images/precision_recall.png)


#### Online demo
Since tensorflo-js is well supported the online deep learning is easy to deploy.
Here I have make a online demo to do local nsfw classification work. You may 
test here https://maybeshewill-cv.github.io/nsfw_classification The whole js work
can be found here https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/MaybeShewill-CV.github.io/tree/master/nsfw_classification
I have supplied a tool to convert the trained tensorflow saved model file into 
tensorflow js model file. In order to generate saved model you can read the 
description about it above. After you generate the tensorflow saved model you 
can simply modify the file path and run the following script

```
cd ROOT_DIR
bash tools/convert_tfjs_model.sh
```
The online demo's example are as follows:
